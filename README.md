# adb_commands
Some useful adb commands for transferring data to/from your android device, without using the native explorer/mtp, just by adb.

# Prerequisites
You should have ADB and the necessary drivers for your device installed.
You can use Minimal ADB and Fastboot for a quicker setup: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790

You can test the working of ADB by opening a command prompt in your Minimal ADB and Fastboot folder and typing "adb devices", if it's working, your device should show up with a device id.

# Usage
 Edit the batch files to specify path to the adb folder.

1. For non-automated batch files, you can specify the path with or without quotation. You can directly copy a path to any file by holding 'Shift' while right clicking it. And then, pasting it by right click inside the command prompt.
2. For automated files, just edit the batch file to your own liking.
